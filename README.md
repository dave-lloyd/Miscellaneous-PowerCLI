# PowerCLI-Snippets

This is a collection of snippets of code and functions for my reference. These are typically all in my Powershell profile for easy accessibility. 

Many are in essence just "wrappers" and glorified one-lines in order to give me that various options that I like to have for a task, without having to copy and paste code - eg, My-GetDetailedVM is essentially Get-VM with all the properties displayed that I want for a reasonably compreshensive overview of the VM. Also, I have used names such as Get-MyVM, Get-MyDatastore which highlight that they're just "my" version of those basic cmdlets.

At one point, some of them, or at least earlier versions, formed a "toolkit". Maybe at somepoint I will re-create something based on them again.
